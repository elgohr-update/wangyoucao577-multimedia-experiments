# gst-tutorials
Experiment [gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) framework.     

## Environments
- `macOS Big Sur(Version 11.4)`
- `Xcode Version 12.5.1(12E507)`(`Apple clang version 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.11)`)    
- `cmake version 3.21.0`
- `brew install gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-ugly`
  - Install gstreamer and its plugins by `brew` rather than [Installing on Mac OS X](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-mac-osx.html?gi-language=c) since it hasn't supported `macOS Big Sur` yet and causes lot of errors.     
  - Installed version: `1.18.4`
